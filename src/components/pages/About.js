            <p className="text-item">Hello! My name is Colin. I am a web developer with an extensive work background in food service and a deep love for technology. Since my early days when my dad allowed me to play StarCraft and Diablo when mom wasnâ€™t home, I've been captivated by the digital world of the computer. My first exposure to programming began at the age of 11 when I discovered Roblox and I tried making my first scripts in Lua. Years later, I dabbled in learning Python during my junior year of high school. Although I didn't explore it very far at the time, the seed was planted, and programming has intrigued me since.</p>
            <p className="text-item">In the fall of 2022, I made a deliberate shift in my career path and enrolled in a coding bootcamp at the University of Minnesota. This experience sparked a deep fascination with software development. Through having intimate discussions with my instructor, a senior developer at Delta Airlines, I began to truly comprehend and value the depth of this field. We stand on the shoulders of giants, and I am truly humbled to be part of the dynamic realm of software and information technology.</p>
            <p className="text-item">With a solid foundation in coding and a desire to take the rabbit hole of technology deeper, I am eager to contribute and apply my skills in a professional setting.</p>
